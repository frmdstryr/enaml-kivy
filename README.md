# About
Implementation of Kivy Widgets for Enaml. Allows you to use the power of Enaml with Kivy apps!


# Why
_Why do this when Kivy lang already exists?_ 

1. Kivy lang at the moment cannot dynamically create and remove widgets without manually doing so in python. Enaml can do this using patterns such as Conditonal and Loopers.
2. Enaml has more flexibility for bindings using the "<<, ::, and :=" operators.  

# How
This project creates the required Enaml classes based on the Kivy widget properties.  New and custom widgets can easily be used in enaml. 

# Usage

See examples folder.
